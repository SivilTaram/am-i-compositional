# Auxiliary scripts

In this folder, you can find several scripts that are helpful to visualise results obtained by using the compositionality evaluation paradigm.
Currently, it contains just one script, `plot_per_function.py` that generates a plot of the accuracy of a model per function.
We will continue to add more useful scripts, if you miss a script that you think could be useful to you, please reach out to <dieuwkehupkes@gmail.com>.
