# PCFGSET compositionality tests

This folder contains the instantiations for the compositionality tests for PCFGSET.
The folder [pcfgset](https://github.com/i-machine-think/am-i-compositional/tree/master/data/pcfgset/pcfgset) contains the basic naturalised PCFGSET corpus, with which the task accuracy can be computed.

The folders [localism](https://github.com/i-machine-think/am-i-compositional/tree/master/data/pcfgset/localism), [productivity](https://github.com/i-machine-think/am-i-compositional/tree/master/data/pcfgset/productivity), [substitutivity](https://github.com/i-machine-think/am-i-compositional/tree/master/data/pcfgset/substitutivity) and [systematicity](https://github.com/i-machine-think/am-i-compositional/tree/master/data/pcfgset/systematicity) contain the data for the test with the corresponding name.
If in the paper for a particular test we conducted auxiliary tests, the data for those tests can be found in the folder of this test.
