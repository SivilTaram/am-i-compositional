# PCFGSET compositionality tests

This folder contains the instantiations for the compositionality tests for PCFGSET.
The folder `pcfgset` contains the basic naturalised PCFGSET corpus, with which the task accuracy can be computed.
The folders `localism`, `productivity`, `substitutivity` and `systematicity` contain the data for the test with the corresponding name.
If in the paper for a particular test we conducted auxiliary tests, the data for those tests can be found in the folder of this test.
